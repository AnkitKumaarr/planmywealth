                      Retirement income plans are often unpredictable due to
                      uncertainties like longevity and market fluctuations. To
                      ensure financial security, it's essential to consider a
                      lifetime annuity with inflation protection, which provides
                      guaranteed monthly or annual income for life. Consult with
                      your financial advisor about available annuity plans

                      A key retirement goal is to be debt-free by age 65. This
                      includes clearing credit card debt, car loans, and
                      mortgages. Many parents take loans later in life for
                      children's education or weddings, but this should be
                      avoided to ensure a secure retirement.

                      Compared to traditional fixed deposits or recurring
                      deposits, SIP provides double the returns. SIP provides

                      invested in ELSS, it has high liquidity and hence can be

                      higher and can help you beat inflation. If you stay

                        There have been numerous cases where the nominee is
                        unaware of the policies taken by the deceased family
                        member. Family members struggle to find the records and
                        make claims. It is important to ensure that your nominee
                        is aware of the policy as well as the details of the
                        policy, where it is stored so that when the need arises
                        your family can make use of your sound financial
                        decision of buying a term insurance policy.
